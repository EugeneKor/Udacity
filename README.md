HTML Syntax reflections:

What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
    - I took several html courses before. All of this so far was a good refresher.
  * What has been difficult?
    - to find and dedicate time to learn between a full-time job and a toddler
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    - Google, MDN, Forums
